		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I grew up in a small town called Greer, which is right outside of Greenville here in South Carolina. I have one sister and she is 2 years younger than me! Additionally, I have 2 dogs, Rylee and Bo! Some of my favorite things include the color pink, Chick-fil-a, country music and warm weather. My hobbies include reading, baking, shopping, spending time outside and participating in any sort of artsy/craft type things!</p>
		<p id="my-text" class="hidden">I've always been interested in skincare, makeup and fashion, so during high school I attended a career center and received my Esthetician license! This enables me to perform a wide variety of services including facials, body wraps/scrubs, waxing, lash lifts/tints, and makeup application! Through my time in this class, I found my passion for skin and the various diseases/disorders that can develop.</p>

		<h2>Future Plans</h2>
		<p>Upon completion of my undergraduate degree, I plan to pursue a Masters of Physician Assistant Studies at an accredited program of my choice. With this degree, I hope to obtain a job as a Physician Assistant specializing in Dermatology, specifically Cosmetic Dermatology and work with cosmetic injectables. Furthermore, I hope to one day open my own medical spa and clincial dermatology practice. The goal is for these two offices to be housed in the same facility as a "one stop shop" for pateints to receive care.</p>
		<p id="my-text2" class="hidden"> In addition to these career related plans, I would like to travel the world with my spouse. Some places I would really like to visit include many different places in Italy such as Florence and the Amalfi Coast. Additionally, I would like to visit Barcellona, Spain and Germany, specifically to visit the concentration camps.Along with traveling, I want to start a family with my spouse and build a house on a piece of land.</p>
